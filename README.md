(2)run the code"python dataset/interhand.py --data_path         --save_path "

training 
run the code "python experiment/train.py ",You can add --gpu at the end to specify the gpu you want to use.And you can get the Model weights file in "output/model/exp"

evaluation
run the code "python experiment/evaluation.py".You need to revise the weight file path which gets in the training in the evaluation.py
